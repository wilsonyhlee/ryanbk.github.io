Welcome! 

I am incoming Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/political-science){:target="_blank"}. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a Predoctoral Fellow at the [Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/){:target="_blank"} at Vanderbilt University.  

I study how salient events interact with voters’ partisan attachments to shape elections and public opinion in the United States. In particular, my research focuses on those voters who live closest to focusing events, are exposed to salient policy changes, and or whose local communities experience worsening policy outcomes. 

In my research, I rigorous causal inference techniques to large-scale survey data and administrative databases while using survey experiments to test specific mechanisms and scope conditions. My dissertation work is supported by a Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship from the [Rapoport Family Foundation](https://www.rapoportfamilyfoundation.com). I am also a member of [the Practical Causal Inference  Lab](https://www.practicallycausal.com).

I am particularly interested in research at the intersection of politics and public health. I have experience collaborating across disciplinary boundaries, including with researchers in medicine, public health, and psychology. I am currently part of the UCLA Health and Politics Project, an interdisciplinary collaboration between social scientists and medical doctors at UCLA and Harvard. I have also published collaborative work with researchers at the Centers for Disease Control. Prior to graduate school, I worked at the [AIDS Institute](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/){:target="_blank"} (New York State Department of Health) and at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/){:target="_blank"}.

My CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/baxter_king_cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The syllabus for a course that I developed and  taught in 2022 and 2024, "Health, Politics, and Culture: Medicare and Medicaid Policy," [is also available](/assets/pdf/medicare_and_medicaid_syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
